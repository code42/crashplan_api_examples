# Uses relativedelta python module that can be downloaded from:
# http://labix.org/python-dateutil
#
# Deactivates users based on the number of months since they have last connected to a master server
# Params:
# 1 arg - number of months (i.e 3)
# 2 arg - type of logging (values: verbose, nonverbose)
# 3 arg - set to deactivate devices or only print the devices that will be deactivated, but not deactivate them.
#        - values: deactivate, print
# Example usages: 
# python deactivateDevices.py 3 verbose print
# python deactivateDevices.py 3 noverbose deactivate
#
# NOTE: Make sure to set cpc_host, cpc_port, cpc_username, cpc_password to your environments values.
